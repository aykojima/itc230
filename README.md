# sp17itc230ListManagementWebApplication

In this first week, you've installed Node.js and learned to execute basic scripts that instantiate a web server.

Now we'll take the first step toward building a full-featured list management web application. Your application should have following files and functionality:

Files in the root directory:
index.js - with code to launch a Node.js web server that can respond to requests
package.json - with information about your application
Files in a ‘public’ sub-folder:
home.html - with any content you want displayed for the home page
Any other static files you care to use
Your web server should send different responses for these urls:
http://localhost:3000 - returns the home.html page
http://localhost:3000/about (Links to an external site.) - returns information about your app
Any other path returns a 404 status code and error message
Push your completed files to your github repo for this class, and submit the main url of your github repo to Canvas
